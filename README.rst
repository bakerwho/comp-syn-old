comp-syn
~~~~~~~

comp-syn is a package which provides a novel methodology to explore relationships between abstract concepts and color. The work arose through a collaboration between the contributors at the Santa Fe Institute's Complex System Summer School 2019. 

NOTE
~~~~

We are in the process of updating the package and will release a new version on PyPi. We will be shifting to the repository `comp-syn/comp-syn <https://github.com/comp-syn/comp-syn>`_. All future pip released will use that repository. It currently contains the latest code and a `Jupyter notebook`<https://github.com/comp-syn/comp-syn/blob/master/compsyn_package_pipeline.ipynb>`_ which demonstrates the methods.

beta-release
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Our beta release (0.1.0) includes only very basic functionality and the finished code to reproduce our entire analysis is on the horizon.


Documentation and Examples
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The
`notebooks <https://github.com/bakerwho/comp-syn/tree/master/notebooks>`__
directory showcases the usage of compsyn, with examples and basic usage.


Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run ``pip install compsyn`` to download and install from PyPI.
